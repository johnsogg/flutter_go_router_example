# navigate

This is a Flutter app that demonstrates how to:

1. Use a Bottom Nav bar
2. Set up Provider v6 to control data, including the desired route

This uses the Go Router package which uses the 'router' paradigm rather than the 'navigation' paradigm. This is more apt for apps that need to support deep linking.
